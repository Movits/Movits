# Hi there! 👋

I'm a Information Technology Management student at UADE in Buenos Aires, Argentina, also pursuing a full-stack development course at the city's renowned professional training center.

As a Brazilian living in Argentina, I've become a multicultural individual fluent in Spanish, English, and Portuguese. Teaching English is another passion of mine, allowing me to bridge language gaps and fostering essential skills such as patience and the ability to simplify complex concepts.

## About My Work 🚀

I love diving into independent coding projects that spark my passion. One such venture led me to create several Discord bots, with DigitsBot being my most significant accomplishment. This bot plays music from YouTube in Discord channels, a solution I developed when my friends couldn't find a bot that catered to their specific needs.

## Currently 🔎

I'm still on my learning journey and thrilled with my progress thus far. I'm eager to dive deeper into the world of programming and believe in continuous learning. I strive to enhance my skills to create effective, efficient, and user-friendly solutions.
